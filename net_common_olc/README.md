## This is my journey to learn c++

# C++ project template for learning learncpp.com

After cloning you should run `./configure` to setup project build configuration
and use `./Run` to run the program it better you run `cmake .` and `make` first or `./build_and_run`

# running and building inside nvim

`<space>r` to run `Run` file
`<space>m` to run `build_and_run` file

if those shortcuts doesn't work run `:source .nvim.lua`
